# Lux Drive — progress

Lux Drive: a browser driving game over the commune of Luxembourg and the commune of Niederanven
(~95 km², plus a 300 m buffer), on Ian's public site.

The engine is the MTB engine (`pb/mtb/`), copied into `pb/lux-drive/` and adapted — `pb/mtb/` is
never edited. The data pipeline lives in `scripts/luxdrive/`.

## Milestone 1 — area + data bake: DONE

**Area.** The OSM admin boundaries (admin_level=8) of Luxembourg and Niederanven, unioned and
buffered by 300 m: **112.95 km²** (the two communes alone are 93.24 km²). The boundaries come from
`scripts/luxdrive/fetch_admin.py` (the node-id cycle of every boundary way is walked and closed),
the union and the buffer from `scripts/luxdrive/bake_area.py` (LUREF / EPSG:2169).

**World frame.** `x = LUREF easting − originE` (east), `z = originNTop − LUREF northing` (south),
metres. World box 16 896 × 14 848 m, aligned to a 512 m block grid.

**Shipped data — 11 389 488 B = 10.86 MB of the 30 MB budget (36 %).**

**Sources.** LiDAR 2024 DTM/DSM (ACT, CC0) from data.public.lu; the LOD2.2 CityGML building model
(ACT, CC0); OSM (ODbL) for the vectors.

**Bakes.** `fetch_admin.py` → `bake_area.py` → `fetch_lidar.py` → `fetch_osm.py` → `bake_terrain.py`
→ `bake_roads.py` → `bake_decks.py` → `bake_buildings.py` → `bake_classes.py` → `bake_lines.py` →
`bake_places.py`. The codec (`scripts/luxdrive/codec.py`) is bit identical to the MTB one, so the
browser decoder reads the grids without changes; the Python side also has a vectorised decoder
(`decode_np`) because the reference one takes half an hour on the 15 M node grid.

**Decisions worth knowing.**

* The near terrain is 4 m, not the MTB's 2 m: the Lux Drive box is nine times bigger and the data
  budget is 30 MB. Measured on the real Luxembourg LiDAR: 4.37 bits/node at 4 m (8.6 MB for the
  whole box), 3.73 bits/node at 2 m (29.2 MB — the whole budget on its own). The bake came out at
  6.7 MB, so there is room left.
* **Bridges are solid decks.** The LiDAR DTM under a bridge is the ground below it, so a bridge is
  not carved: the road surface of the bridge is the LiDAR DSM. Every OSM way tagged `bridge=yes`
  becomes a deck with the real height at every point (read from the 2 m DSM) and with its two ends
  pinned to the ground, so it meets the approach road exactly. 361 decks.
* **Tunnels are not drivable; they get their portals.** The René Konen / Hellege-Geescht tunnel
  (the A1 under the city, `layer=-3`) runs 2 km under streets that are themselves in the network.
  A single-valued height field cannot have a hole, so a tunnel cannot be a trench with a road in it
  without cutting a canyon through the city. The tunnel ways are therefore kept out of the carve
  and out of the drivable network, and the game draws a portal at each end of every tunnel — the
  option the brief allows ("or at least correct portals").
* The buildings follow the terrain: the game samples the ground under every footprint point, so
  nothing floats and nothing is buried, whatever the slope.
* The class map combines the OSM land use, the LiDAR canopy (a wood is a wood even where OSM does
  not say so) and the building footprints (the city is urban).

**Open bugs:** none known in the bake. The gates of Milestone 4 still have to run.

## Milestone 2 — drive: IN PROGRESS

The MTB engine is copied into `pb/lux-drive/` and adapted: the world constants (16.9 × 14.8 km,
4 m near grid), the way network (roads instead of trails), the bridge decks, the car physics and
the chase camera.

**Done so far.** `config.js` (every constant), `codec.js` (MBG1 + the class raster), `roads.js`
(the road decoder and the class table), `road-network.js` (the carve), `decks.js` (the bridge
decks), `heightfield.js` (the height function), `surface.js` (the 1 m lattice shared by the
physics and the LOD 0 tiles), `world-data.js` (the loaders), plus verbatim copies of `noise.js`,
`base-field.js`, `quadtree.js`, `light-glsl.js`, `solid-material.js`, `mesh-builder.js`.

**How a road is carved in.** There is no ribbon: the ground under the carriageway is mixed towards
the road bed (the LiDAR DTM along the centre line, smoothed), the kerb is a 13 cm ridge at the edge
of the carriageway and the pavement lies outside it. The distance to a road is the distance to its
*polyline*, so a straight road has a straight edge.

Four rules came out of measuring the carve on the real data (2 504 575 half-metre steps along every
carved centre line of the 19 314 ways):

* Only the roads a car may drive on are carved. A footpath that follows a 40 % slope is not a road:
  carving it cuts a trench into the hillside.
* The contributions of the roads near a point are **summed**, not "the nearest one wins" (the way the
  MTB engine carves its trails): where two roads meet their beds are averaged, so a junction has no
  step, and where one road ends the other one takes over. Two roads that meet on a steep slope have
  beds that differ by metres — each was smoothed along its own direction — and the average puts them
  back together.
* The bed may not leave the ground under it by more than **1.5 m**: a street that runs over a cliff
  must not be smoothed into the cliff face, and a road that climbs a hill must not cut 5 m into it.
* A road only shapes the ground that lies at its **own level**: its influence fades out between 2.5 m
  and 5 m. Without this, a street on the ledge 30 m above a valley street covered the valley street
  from above and pulled its bed up the cliff — a 9 m step in the middle of the road. The fade is soft
  on purpose: a hard cut steps the bed at the foot of a cliff, where the ground passes the road's
  level.

**Measured on the real data** (the carve must not be rougher than the ground it lies on):

| how much rougher the road is than the ground below it | steps |
|---|---:|
| under 5 cm | 2 464 961 |
| under 20 cm | 39 073 |
| under 50 cm | 517 |
| under 1 m | 16 |
| under 2 m | 7 |
| over 2 m | 1 (2.41 m, a track that crosses a cliff at the east edge) |

Six of the 19 314 ways have a step above 1 m; every point of every carved centre line is fully
covered (no hole in a road), and the carved road never leaves the ground under it by more than
1.63 m (99.9th percentile: 1.49 m).

**The canopy lattice.** The bake wrote the canopy on a 32 m lattice while `terrain.json` said 16 m
(the window and the decimation were counted in 4 m steps, not in metres). Fixed in
`bake_terrain.py` and re-baked: the canopy is now really 16 m (1057 × 929 nodes), which costs
1 MB more (still 36 % of the budget).
